## Execute for yourself
Everyone trying to execute this for yourself. What is needed is a Postgres database.
1. Restore the dump by executing: 
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres -d my_new_database
\i database.sql
2. Adjust the connection details in the database.py file in the Helpers folder.
3. Put a **api_key.txt** file inside of your repository. Get an API key for Gemini from  this [link](https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faistudio.google.com%2Fapikey%3F_gl%3D1*7la1jo*_ga*MTk5NjU0NjI5Ni4xNzI4Mzk0NDI1*_ga_P1DBVKWT6V*MTczMzMzMDExNi40OS4wLjE3MzMzMzAxMTYuMC4wLjIwNzE4NDIzNzE.&followup=https%3A%2F%2Faistudio.google.com%2Fapikey%3F_gl%3D1*7la1jo*_ga*MTk5NjU0NjI5Ni4xNzI4Mzk0NDI1*_ga_P1DBVKWT6V*MTczMzMzMDExNi40OS4wLjE3MzMzMzAxMTYuMC4wLjIwNzE4NDIzNzE.&ifkv=AcMMx-cgPRy-Na5Uk6-Y0SPg2IKv4vGdWFZfpm_pHtAWq2oKvGhvMcHVvHyORe9A9j-8TUwVP1MU&passive=1209600&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin&dsh=S-132392570%3A1733330134082602&ddm=1).
